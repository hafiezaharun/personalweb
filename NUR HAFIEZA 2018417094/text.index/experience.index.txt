<p align="center"><font size="4">For experience, I once climbed a Bukit Larut located near Taiping. It was 2 years ago; I go with my 2 friends.
We go there because we have nothing to do at home and we have so much time after we finish our SPM exam. It was 
spontaneous plan we make; we decide one day before we go to hiking. It was great experience with my friends.</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="center"><font size="4">We take about 1 hour to finish climbed the Bukit Larut because this is our first experience climbed Bukit Larut. When climbing it 
is quite difficult but when it reaches the top it is very satisfying and gives joy to oneself. The view of the soluble hills is also 
beautiful.</font></p>

we donâ€™t win the competition. However, I can get closer with my friend during this choral speaking preparation.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Third experience is me and my friend vacation for 2 days 1 night only in Penang during the semester break. We went by train and 
ferry together. We visit interesting places there, it is very tiring because we walk a lot towards the place we are going to. But, it was a memorable experience 
and this experience happened before Covid-19, we also have plans to go again but buried due to Covid-19. My university friend and I have not seen each other for 
a long time after online distance learning.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">This is the top 3 experiences in my live that I think are very memorable for me, even though there are other experiences that
I do with my friends.</font></p>
